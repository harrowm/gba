# Analysis of ThumbCPU::thumb_alu_lsr Performance Bottleneck

echo "=== WHY thumb_alu_lsr IS 18.2% OF EXECUTION TIME ==="
echo ""

echo "üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:"
echo ""
echo "1. BUG IN BENCHMARK CODE:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Comment says 'LSL R1, R2' but generates LSR instructions"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 0x4051 | (2 << 6) = 0x40D1 ‚Üí ALU opcode 3 = LSR"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ LSR is more expensive than LSL due to carry flag complexity"
echo ""

echo "2. EXECUTION FREQUENCY:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 33% of ALU benchmark instructions are LSR operations"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 100,000 iterations √ó 100 instructions √ó 33% = 3.3M LSR calls"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ High frequency makes any inefficiency amplified"
echo ""

echo "3. PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS IN thumb_alu_lsr():"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Multiple function calls: updateCFlagShiftLSR(), updateZFlag(), updateNFlag()"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Complex carry flag calculation for shift operations"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Multiple parentCPU.R()[] register accesses"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ String construction for debug (even when disabled)"
echo ""

echo "üõ†Ô∏è SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:"
echo ""
echo "1. IMMEDIATE FIXES:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Fixed benchmark bug - now correctly generates LSL (opcode 2)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ This should reduce LSR profiling impact significantly"
echo ""

echo "2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Create C fast-path for LSR (similar to ARM approach)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Inline common ALU operations (LSR, EOR, AND)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Cache register references to reduce pointer chasing"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Optimize flag update functions"
echo ""

echo "3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Add thumb_execute_optimizations.c with fast C implementations"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use direct flag manipulation instead of function calls"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Implement switch-based dispatch for hottest ALU ops"
echo ""

echo "üî• EXPECTED IMPACT:"
echo ""
echo "After fixing the benchmark bug:"
echo "‚Ä¢ LSR should drop from 18.2% to much lower"
echo "‚Ä¢ LSL (actual intended operation) should show up in profiling"
echo "‚Ä¢ Overall ALU performance should improve"
echo ""

echo "If LSR is still a bottleneck after the fix:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Indicates real-world code uses LSR heavily"
echo "‚Ä¢ Worth optimizing with C fast-path"
echo "‚Ä¢ Could achieve 5-10% overall performance improvement"
echo ""

echo "üéØ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Re-run benchmark with fixed LSL instruction"
echo "2. Profile again to see new bottlenecks"
echo "3. If LSR still appears, implement C fast-path"
echo "4. Consider broader ALU optimization strategy"
