## Key Observations

### ARM Cache + Invalidation Impact
The ARM instruction cache with invalidation shows solid performance:
- **Best Performance**: Multiply instructions (540M IPS peak)
- **Good Performance**: Arithmetic (363M IPS) and Branch (316M IPS)
- **Moderate Performance**: ALU operations (317M IPS) and Memory access (259M IPS)
- **Complex Operations**: Multiple data transfer (111M IPS) - expected due to complexity

### ARM vs Thumb Detailed Comparison

| Instruction Type | ARM Peak IPS | Thumb Peak IPS | ARM Advantage |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Arithmetic**   | 363M         | 529M           | ❌ Thumb +46% |
| **Memory**       | 259M         | 485M           | ❌ Thumb +87% |
| **ALU Ops**      | 317M         | 473M           | ❌ Thumb +49% |
| **Branches**     | 316M         | 317M           | ✅ ARM ~Equal |
| **Multiply**     | 540M         | N/A            | ✅ ARM Only   |
| **Multi-Transfer** | 111M       | N/A            | ✅ ARM Only   |

### Performance Characteristics
1. **Cache Effectiveness**: ARM cache provides consistent performance with invalidation safety
2. **Thumb Efficiency**: Thumb's 16-bit encoding and simpler decode gives significant advantages
3. **Instruction Density**: Thumb uses 50% less memory bandwidth (16-bit vs 32-bit)
4. **Branch Performance**: ARM and Thumb now have comparable branch performance (~316-317M IPS)
5. **Complex Instructions**: ARM's multiply and block transfer instructions have no Thumb equivalent

## Recommendations

### Updated Performance-Based Recommendations
1. **For ALU-heavy code**: Thumb mode strongly preferred (46-87% faster)
2. **For branch-heavy code**: Either mode performs equally well (~316-317M IPS)
3. **For mixed workloads**: Thumb generally preferred due to overall efficiency
4. **For multiply-heavy code**: ARM mode required (no Thumb equivalent)
5. **For block transfers**: ARM mode required (LDM/STM not in Thumb)

### Cache Tuning Opportunities
- Current cache provides good hit rates (33% in tests)
- Consider increasing cache size for better hit rates in real games
- Associative cache could reduce conflicts for tight loops

## Implementation Status

### ✅ **COMPLETED Features**
1. **ARM Instruction Cache**: 1024-entry direct-mapped cache implemented
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic invalidation on memory writes (tested and working)
3. **Performance Testing**: Comprehensive benchmarks comparing ARM vs Thumb
4. **Integration**: Clean integration with existing codebase via Makefile
5. **Validation**: Cache invalidation test confirms correctness for self-modifying code

### Cache Invalidation Test Results
```
✓ Cache Population: Instruction cached correctly (1 miss)
✓ Cache Hit: Second execution uses cache (1 hit, 33% hit rate)
✓ Memory Write: Cache invalidation triggered (+1 invalidation)
✓ Post-Invalidation: Modified instruction executed correctly
✓ Correctness: No stale instruction execution
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Implement cache invalidation for self-modifying code 
2. Add more sophisticated cache replacement policies (LRU, associative)
3. Profile cache hit rates in real games and optimize cache size
4. Optimize cached execution functions further (currently call original implementations)
