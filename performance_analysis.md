- **ALU Operations**: 444M - 459M IPS
- **Branch Instructions**: 285M - 288M IPS

## Key Observations

### ARM Cache Impact
The ARM instruction cache shows significant performance improvements:
- **Best Performance**: ALU operations (340M IPS) and Branch instructions (344M IPS)
- **Good Performance**: Memory access (305M IPS) and Multiply (529M IPS peak)
- **Moderate Performance**: Arithmetic (217M IPS) and Multiple transfers (178M IPS)

### ARM vs Thumb Comparison
- **Thumb Advantages**:
  - Higher ALU performance (459M vs 340M IPS)
  - Better memory access performance (407M vs 305M IPS)
  - More consistent across instruction types
  
- **ARM Advantages**:
  - Better branch performance (344M vs 288M IPS)
  - More instruction types (multiply, block transfers)
  - Higher theoretical throughput for complex operations

### Performance Characteristics
1. **Instruction Cache Effectiveness**: ARM cache provides good speedup for control flow
2. **Thumb Efficiency**: Thumb's simpler decoding gives it an edge in ALU/memory ops
3. **Instruction Density**: Thumb uses less memory bandwidth (16-bit vs 32-bit)

## Recommendations

1. **For ALU-heavy code**: Thumb mode preferred
2. **For branch-heavy code**: ARM mode with cache preferred  
3. **For mixed workloads**: Consider dynamic switching based on code patterns
4. **Cache tuning**: Consider increasing cache size or associativity for ARM

## Next Steps

1. Profile cache hit rates and effectiveness
2. Implement cache invalidation for self-modifying code
3. Add more sophisticated cache replacement policies
4. Optimize cached execution functions further
