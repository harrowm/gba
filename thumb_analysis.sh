echo "=== Thumb CPU Performance Analysis ==="
echo ""

echo "From profiling data, we can see the key performance bottlenecks in Thumb CPU:"
echo ""
echo "1. ThumbCPU::execute (36.4%) - Main execution loop"
echo "2. ThumbCPU::thumb_alu_lsr (18.2%) - ALU logical shift right"
echo "3. Memory::read16 (9.1%) - 16-bit memory reads"
echo "4. Memory::write32 (9.1%) - 32-bit memory writes"
echo "5. ThumbCPU::thumb_add_register (9.1%) - Register addition"
echo "6. ThumbCPU::thumb_alu_eor (9.1%) - ALU exclusive OR"
echo ""

echo "=== Comparison with ARM CPU Analysis ==="
echo ""
echo "ARM CPU bottlenecks (from previous analysis):"
echo "• ARMCPU::execute - Main execution loop"
echo "• ARMCPU::decodeAndExecute - Instruction decoding"
echo "• arm_execute_* functions - Various instruction execution"
echo "• Memory operations - Memory access"
echo ""

echo "=== Key Differences ==="
echo ""
echo "1. INSTRUCTION EXECUTION STRUCTURE:"
echo "   • ARM: Uses separate decode/execute phases with C fast-paths"
echo "   • Thumb: Direct C++ function pointer dispatch from instruction table"
echo ""
echo "2. MEMORY ACCESS PATTERNS:"
echo "   • ARM: 32-bit aligned memory accesses"
echo "   • Thumb: 16-bit aligned memory accesses (more frequent)"
echo ""
echo "3. INSTRUCTION DENSITY:"
echo "   • ARM: 32-bit instructions, fewer total instructions"
echo "   • Thumb: 16-bit instructions, more instructions but smaller"
echo ""

echo "=== Performance Insights ==="
echo ""
echo "1. Thumb ALU operations (LSR, EOR) are showing up as hotspots"
echo "2. Memory operations are significant but not dominant"
echo "3. The execute loop itself is a major bottleneck"
echo "4. Individual Thumb instruction handlers are called more frequently"
echo ""

echo "=== Optimization Opportunities ==="
echo ""
echo "1. **ALU Operations Fast-Path**: Similar to ARM's approach"
echo "   - Create C implementations for frequently used ALU operations"
echo "   - Focus on LSR, EOR, and other common operations"
echo ""
echo "2. **Execute Loop Optimization**: "
echo "   - Reduce overhead in the main execution loop"
echo "   - Inline common operations"
echo ""
echo "3. **Memory Access Optimization**:"
echo "   - Optimize 16-bit memory access patterns"
echo "   - Consider memory access caching strategies"
echo ""
echo "4. **Instruction Dispatch Optimization**:"
echo "   - Consider direct switch statements for hottest instructions"
echo "   - Inline common instruction handlers"
echo ""

echo "=== Recommendation ==="
echo ""
echo "Based on the profiling data, Thumb CPU shows different bottlenecks than ARM:"
echo "• Thumb spends more time in individual ALU operations"
echo "• ARM spends more time in decode/execute infrastructure"
echo ""
echo "The current Thumb implementation is already quite efficient due to:"
echo "• Direct function pointer dispatch (no decode phase)"
echo "• Simpler instruction format"
echo "• Better cache locality with 16-bit instructions"
echo ""
echo "If optimization is desired, focus on:"
echo "1. Creating C fast-paths for ALU operations (LSR, EOR, etc.)"
echo "2. Optimizing the execute loop"
echo "3. Memory access patterns"
echo ""
echo "However, the current ~1.6x performance advantage of Thumb over ARM"
echo "suggests the implementation is already well-optimized!"
