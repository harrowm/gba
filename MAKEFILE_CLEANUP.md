# Makefile Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

The Makefile has been cleaned up to reduce the number of ARM benchmark variants from 4 down to 2, keeping only the most useful ones:

### Removed Targets:
- `arm_benchmark_opt` - Redundant with main `arm_benchmark` 
- `arm_benchmark_ultra` - Over-optimization with minimal benefit

### Kept Targets:
- `arm_benchmark` - Optimized benchmark with -O3 -flto flags
- `arm_benchmark_prof` - Profiling-enabled benchmark with gperftools

### Key Improvements:

1. **Simplified Build Targets**: Reduced from 4 ARM benchmark variants to 2 essential ones
2. **Cleaner Configuration**: Removed ultra-optimization flags that had minimal benefit
3. **Consistent Naming**: Both benchmarks now use the same source file (`simple_benchmark.cpp`)
4. **Better Organization**: Removed redundant optimization level flags

### Current ARM Benchmark Targets:

#### `arm_benchmark`
- **Purpose**: Primary optimized benchmark for performance testing
- **Optimization**: `-O3 -flto` (aggressive optimization with link-time optimization)
- **Use Case**: Regular performance testing and validation
- **Command**: `make arm_benchmark` or `make run-arm-benchmark`

#### `arm_benchmark_prof` 
- **Purpose**: Profiling-enabled benchmark for performance analysis
- **Optimization**: `-O2` (moderate optimization to preserve debug info)
- **Profiling**: Links with gperftools (`-lprofiler`)
- **Use Case**: Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- **Command**: `make arm_benchmark_prof` or `make run-arm-benchmark-prof`

### Benefits of This Cleanup:

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer targets to maintain and understand
2. **Focused Purpose**: Each remaining target has a clear, distinct purpose
3. **Faster Builds**: Less redundant compilation during `make tests`
4. **Cleaner Documentation**: Simplified help and status output
5. **Better Maintainability**: Fewer build configurations to keep in sync

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Build and run optimized benchmark
make run-arm-benchmark

# Build and run profiling benchmark  
make run-arm-benchmark-prof

# Build all tests (now includes only 2 ARM benchmarks)
make tests

# Clean everything
make clean
```

This cleanup maintains all the essential functionality while removing redundant complexity, making the build system more maintainable and easier to understand.
